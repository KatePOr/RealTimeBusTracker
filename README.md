# RealTimeBusTracker
A web application that allows the user to move between stops on a bus line between MIT and Harvard.

How to run: Open the html file. Click on "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" to move the marker across the map.

Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to add street addresses next to each marker so a user will know where each stop is. This will make the experience easier for the user utilizing the map.
